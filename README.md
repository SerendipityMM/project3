# B2C-E-commerceApp
Project 3 

The project has two components Client(React) and server-side(Node.js/Express). Client: React is a powerful javascript library for building the user interface and allows for a rather convenient way of storing and maniulating the state of the app. Server: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
